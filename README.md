# Module 1 Challenge
- This is a README for our first challenge for our coding bootcamp
## Description 
- Refactoring existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers
## What I did
- Refactored code by improving the existing code without changing what it does
- Changed the HTML elements and CSS selectors that go together to have a coherent semantic structure
- Added alt text where needed for images
- Reorganize the CSS into a logical structure that is more organized
- Edited the heading attributes for a more sequential order
- Added a concise, descriptive title
- Changed the elements to follow a logical structure of styling and positioning
### Why are we doing this?
- To practice on editing code for a more professional organized look
- To have a better understanding on indication of the HTML elements
